# Exploring the Role of Networks in Predicting and Improving Social Mobility

Interested in contributing to the ongoing conversation on decreasing rates of intergenerational betterment in the 
United States, the project explores the role of social networks in promoting upward economic mobility. The project 
utilizes data on zip code-wise connectedness to develop a network between zip codes to explore the relationships 
between economic connectedness and social mobility. By analyzing the Socio-Economic Status (SES) and 
connectedness of communities, we investigate how high economic connectedness and high PageRank communities 
can contribute to higher rates of social mobility.
